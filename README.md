# hello-world
start programming practice

I love web design and development. I also love everything about python, because i feel i have a personal calling on these two programming activities. Web development is the latest magic in programming. In real world we disregard make-ups but in programming we love make-ups alot, our major one being the bootstrap - thanks to twitter for such an amazing technology. 
Sooner or later i will be launching my projects on this platform.
